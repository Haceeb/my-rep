first day of my internship, Basically em here for android internship. I prepare myself for the interview three days before the today.
As em thinking that they are gonna take my intrview about android but when I came here the things are sprisingly diffrent.
I love to solve riddles with curiousity and when I sit for the interview I got three diffrent kind off riddles from the owner of this company. let me teel you about the owner of the company. His name is Mr. Aamir and guys bleive me he is not as other boss  in the offices he is the most nice kinda boss of a company i have eveer met. He is very jolly person. When I arrived to the office first I was thinking anout my interview like may be its so hard for me to pass this interview, or may be its so easy for me to fail lol :p in short em very confuse but when I entered in the office I saw a person with whime refrence I came here, and I can recognise him by the way
